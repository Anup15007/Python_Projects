Problem Statement 1:
Value Inc is a retail store that sells household items all over the world by bulk.
The Sales Manager has no sales reporting but he has a brief idea of current sales.
He also has no idea of the monthly cost, profit and top selling products. He wants a
dashboard on this and says the data is currently stored in an excel sheet.

Problem Statement 2:
Blue Bank is a bank in USA that has a loan department which is currently understaffed.
They supply loans to individuals and don’t have much reporting on how risky these
